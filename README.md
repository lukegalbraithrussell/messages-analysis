# messages-analysis

Want to analyze facebook messages? Download your information in facebook's settings as a JSON and run FacebookMessages.ipynb, changing the files paths and names to fit your configuration.

Want to analyze SMS messages? Download your information as an xml file (lots of apps will do this) and use smsMessages.ipynb

Want to analyze both? Run FacebookMessages.ipynb and smsMessages.ipynb at least to the cell where they output .csv files. Open up and run SMS_FB_Analysis.ipynb.

Word Counts is a work in process.
